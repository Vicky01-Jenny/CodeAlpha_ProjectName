README for Iris Dataset EDA project
Task 2 :Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris Dataset

 Project Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the classic Iris Dataset, one of the most well-known datasets in data science and machine learning.  
The goal is to explore, visualize, and understand relationships among flower measurements (sepal and petal lengths and widths) across three Iris species Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

Through this analysis, we uncover hidden patterns, correlations, and distinctions among the species, laying the groundwork for future machine learning tasks such as classification.

 Objectives
- Load and inspect the Iris dataset structure  
- Handle missing or inconsistent data  
- Analyze statistical summaries and feature distributions  
- Visualize data using plots to identify trends and relationships  
- Draw insights and interpret patterns between species  

Dataset Information
Dataset Name: Iris  
Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)  
Number of Instances:150  
Number of Features: 4  
Features:
1. Sepal Length (cm)  
2. Sepal Width (cm)  
3. Petal Length (cm)  
4. Petal Width (cm)  
-Target Variable: Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

Steps Performed

1. Data Loading & Overview
   - Loaded dataset using pandas
   - Displayed first few rows, column names, and data types

2. Data Cleaning
   - Checked for missing or null values
   - Ensured numeric data types for quantitative features

3. Statistical Summary
   - Used describe () for mean, standard deviation, and range
   - Identified patterns in petal and sepal dimensions

4. Data Visualization
   - Histograms for feature distributions  
   - Boxplots for outlier detection  
   - Pairplots to visualize feature relationships by species  
   - Heatmap for correlation analysis  
   - Violin plots for species-wise feature variation

5. Insights and Observations
   - Petal features show stronger separation between species  than sepal features  
   - Iris-setosa is clearly distinct from the other two species  
   - Sepal length and petal length are positively correlated  
   - No significant missing or duplicate values found  

Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas – data handling  
- NumPy – numerical computations  
- Matplotlib – plotting and visualization  
- Seaborn – advanced statistical visualization  

 Findings
- EDA helps uncover important relationships within the data before modeling.  
- Visual patterns make Setosa easily separable, suggesting high classification accuracy.  
- This analysis builds a strong foundation for supervised learning tasks (e.g., logistic regression, SVM, decision trees).
